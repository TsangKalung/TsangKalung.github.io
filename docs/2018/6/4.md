## C++

* || and && have a strategy for short circuit evaluation.

## ES6

* All internally defined `methods` of a class are `non-enumerable`.
* Inside classes and modules, the `strict mode` is the **default**, so you do not need to specify the operating mode with `use strict`. As long as your code is written in a class or module, only `strict mode` is available.
* A `class` must have a `constructor` method. If there is no explicit definition, an empty `constructor` method is added by **default**.
* The `class` must use the `new` call, otherwise it will report an error. This is a major difference between it and the ordinary `constructor`, which can be executed without `new`.
* All instances of a `class` share a `prototype object`.
