## MIDI

* MIDI messages are made up of 8-bit words (commonly called `bytes`) that are transmitted serially at a rate of **31.25 kbit/s**. This rate was chosen because it is an exact division of 1 MHz, the operational speed of many early microprocessors.The first bit of each word identifies whether the word is a status byte or a data byte, and is followed by seven bits of information.A start bit and a stop bit are added to each byte for framing purposes, so a MIDI byte requires ten bits for transmission.
