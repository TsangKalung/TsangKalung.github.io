## CS:APP

* The programs that perform the four phases(preprocessor,compiler,assembler,andlinker)are known collectively as the *compilation system*.
* The preprocessor (cpp) modifies the original C programaccording  to  directives  that  begin  with  the **#** character. 
* Assembly language is useful because it provides a common output language for different compilers for  different  high-level  languages.
