* Here, the `for-in` statement is used to display all the `properties` of the `BOM` window object. Each time through the loop, **the propName variable is filled with the name of a property that exists on the window object**. This continues until all of the available properties have been enumerated over. As with the for statement, the `var` operator in the control statement is not necessary but is recommended for **ensuring the use of a local variable**.

```Javascript
    for (var propName in window) {
        document.write(propName);
    }
```

* Object properties in ECMAScript are **unordered**, so the order in which property names are returned in a `for-in` statement cannot necessarily be predicted. All enumerable properties will be returned once, but the order may differ across browsers.
* Both the `break` and `continue` statements can be used in conjunction with `labeled statements` to return to a particular location in the code. This is typically used when there are **loops inside of loops**.
* The `with` statement was created as a convenience for times when a single object was being coded to over and over again.
