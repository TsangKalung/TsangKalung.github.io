## _Thinking in Java_

* You can also initialize nonprimitive objects in this same way.
* When the data is `static`, if it’s a primitive and you don’t initialize it, it gets the standard primitive initial values. If it’s areference to an object, it’s null unless you create a new object and attach your reference to it.
* Second, both `Cleanser` and `Detergent` contain a `main( )` method. You can create a main( ) for each one of your classes, and it’s often recommended to code this way so that your test code is wrapped in with the class.
* Java has the keyword super that refers to the “superclass” that the current class has been inherited from. Thus the expression super.scrub( ) calls the baseclass version of the method scrub( ).
