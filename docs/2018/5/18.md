* ECMAScript functions cannot be overloaded in the traditional sense.
  * Functions in ECMAScript don’t have signatures, because the arguments are represented as an array containing zero or more values.
  * If two functions are defined to have the same name in ECMAScript, it is the **last function** that becomes the owner of that name.
* Cheet log:
  * Unlike other languages, there’s no separate data type for integers versus floating-point values; the Number type represents all numbers.
  * Functions that don’t specify a return value actually return the special value `undefined`.
* When a function is called, an **execution context** is created, and its scope chain is created. The **activation object** for the function is initialized with values for `arguments` and any named arguments.
* **Since the `window` object doubles as the ECMAScript Global object**, all variables and functions declared globally become properties and methods of the window object.
* There is a slight difference between defining a global variable and defi ning a property directly on `window`: global variables cannot be removed using the `delete` operator, while properties defi ned directly on window can.
